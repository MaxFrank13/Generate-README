## Installation

Make sure you have Node installed first, then run `npm i` or `npm install`. Once the installation is complete, run `node index.js` and you should receive prompts in the terminal. Each answer to that prompt corresponds to a section on the README. Your generated README can be found in the 'generated' directory. Each time you generate a README, this file will be overwritten. Make sure you to save it somewhere else before generating a new one.

## Usage

This can be used for any README. Adding screenshots or other fine details will need to be done after, however the basic structure of a professional README is provided.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repo and use it for yourself!

## Tests
